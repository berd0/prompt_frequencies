# prompt_frequencies
This simple script takes an input folder with txt files and outputs another txt file with the frequency of prompting tags in this training data file.

I recommend taking the training folder prepared by Kohya_ss and using that as input. The output folder I recommend any other folder that is easily accessible. 

Improvements to the script are welcome.
